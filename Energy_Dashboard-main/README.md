## Pakistan Energy Dashboard

This is an interactive dashboard that allows users to understand and visualize the energy mix of Pakistan over the last 3 decades to capture the change over time. The users can interact with the map and see the progression and change in the installed and generation capacity to grasp the policy decisions made by successive governments.
